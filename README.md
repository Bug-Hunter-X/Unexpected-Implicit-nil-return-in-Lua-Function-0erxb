This repository demonstrates a common subtle error in Lua programming:  implicit nil returns from functions.  The `bug.lua` file contains code that demonstrates how a function may implicitly return nil when a specific condition isn't met, which may lead to unexpected behavior or hard-to-debug errors. The `bugSolution.lua` file shows the corrected version where `nil` is explicitly returned.
